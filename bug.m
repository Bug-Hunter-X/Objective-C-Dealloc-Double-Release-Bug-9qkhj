In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error stems from the misuse of `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` within custom `dealloc` methods.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myObject release]; // Correct if myObject is retained
    [super dealloc];
}
```

If `myObject` was not retained by `MyClass` (e.g., assigned using `assign` instead of `retain`), calling `release` on it in `dealloc` will lead to a double-release and a crash.  This subtle mistake can be easily missed, especially in complex inheritance hierarchies.
